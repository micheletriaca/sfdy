# sfdy

sfdy is a command line tool to work with the [Salesforce Metadata API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_meta.meta/api_meta/meta_intro.htm).
It has been built to work around strange behaviours and known limitations of the api, and to simplify the implementation of a continuous integration process. It applies [useful patches](#apply-standard-patches-and-renderers-to-metadata) to avoid common problems when deploying metadata, and it exposes a simple interface to [build your own plugins](#build-your-own-plugins)

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) at least `10.x.x`

## Usage

`sfdy` is meant to be mainly used as a command line tool. It can also be used a library since it exposes a small [API](#use-sfdy-as-a-library).

Type `sfdy --help` to see available commands. Type `sfdy [command] --help` to see available options for a specific command

## Why not SFDX?

[SFDX](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli) is a tool to work with scratch orgs and with modular projects.

In a typical salesforce project, development starts in a scratch org or in a classic sandbox.
Even if you use scratch orgs, however, sooner or later you'll have to deploy your sfdx project to a classic sandbox (a shared, persistant development sandbox used to test integrations, an UAT sandbox, etc.). After the code is deployed to a classic sandbox, we are right back where we started.

Moreover, DX requires the developer to break down their entire Enterprise org into individual projects, but sometimes this is not possible/advisable or the sub-projects are still too big to be worked on by a single developer. Salesforce metadata are deeply interconnected, and every module is very likely to use a subset of common functionalities (standard objects, layout, flexipages). It is often a nightmare to divide an enterprise project in modules, because those modules are not really independent from each other.

Finally, this tool solves some problems that SFDX does not address, and gives the developer an easy way to customize a Salesforce CI process the way HE/SHE wants. To have the best possible experience, use this tool in conjunction with the vscode plugin [fast-sfdc](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=m1ck83.fast-sfdc). patches and even your custom plugins are automatically applied in both your CI flow and your local development environment!

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g sfdy
```

then go to the root folder of a Salesforce project, and type

```bash
sfdy init
```

this command creates a `.sfdy.json` file whithin the root folder of your current workspace with the configuration of the 'standard' patches (more on this [later](#apply-standard-patches-and-renderers-to-metadata))

### Authenticate to Salesforce

You can pass username and password in all the available commands. For example:

```bash
sfdy retrieve -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD ...
```

Otherwise, just type:

```bash
sfdy auth -s
```

This command will start an oauth2 web server flow an will output a refresh token and an instance url.

The `-s` flag should be used when connecting to a sandbox.

The `refresh token` can be used in all the available commands as an authentication method instead of username+password. Example:

```bash
sfdy retrieve --refresh-token REFRESH_TOKEN --instance-url INSTANCE_URL -s ...
```

If you want to avoid passing `refresh token` and `instance url` all the times, you can use the auth command in this way:

```bash
eval $(sfdy auth -s -e)
```

This will set the returned `refresh token` and `instance url` as environment variables. The subsequent commands will read them from the enviroment. Example:

```bash
sfdy retrieve -s ...
```

Otherwise, you can just export them manually:

```bash
sfdy auth -s
export SFDY_REFRESH_TOKEN=refreshtoken
export SFDY_INSTANCE_URL=instanceurl
```

By default, the SFDY connected app will be used. If you want to use yours, you can pass a user defined `client_id` and `client_secret` in all the available commands.

```bash
sfdy auth --client-id CLIENT_ID --client-secret CLIENT_SECRET -s ...

sfdy retrieve --refresh-token REFRESH_TOKEN --instance-url INSTANCE_URL --client-id CLIENT_ID --client-secret CLIENT_SECRET -s ...
```

Or you can use the env vars:

```bash
export SFDY_REFRESH_TOKEN=refreshtoken
export SFDY_INSTANCE_URL=instanceurl
export SFDY_CLIENT_ID=clientid
export SFDY_CLIENT_SECRET=clientsecret
sfdy retrieve -s ...
```

> **Warning:** You must add `http://localhost:3000/callback` as redirect_uri in your connected app setup

### Retrieve full metadata

From the root folder of your salesforce project, type:

```bash
sfdy retrieve -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -s
```

This command will retrieve all metadata specified in package.xml and will apply any enabled patch.

The `-s` flag should be used when connecting to a sandbox.

### Retrieve partial metadata

#### using --files

```bash
sfdy retrieve -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -s --files='objects/*,!objects/{Account,Contact}*,site*/**/*'
```

This command will retrieve all objects present in the local `objects` folder, except those which name starts with `Account` or `Contact`, and will retrieve all metadata (present in the local project) which folder starts with `site` (for example `sites`, `siteDotCom`)

The --files consists in a comma-separated list of [glob patterns](https://www.npmjs.com/package/globby)

> **Warning:** Negated patterns always have the highest precedence

#### using --meta

```bash
sfdy retrieve -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -s --meta='CustomObject/Account,FlexiPage/*'
```

This command will retrieve the Account object and all the flexipages present on the target salesforce environment

> **Warning:** the --meta option builds an ad-hoc package.xml to retrieve the data. Glob patterns cannot be used in this case. You can use a wildcard only if that metadata type supports it

### Deploy full metadata

```bash
sfdy deploy -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -s
```

This command will apply any enabled pre-deploy patch and will deploy all metadata specified in package.xml.

The `-s` flag should be used when connecting to a sandbox.

### Deploy partial metadata

#### using --files

```bash
sfdy deploy -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -s --files='objects/*,!objects/Account*,site*/**/*'
```

This command will deploy all objects present in the local `objects` folder, except those which name starts with `Account`, and will deploy all metadata (present in the local project) which folder starts with `site` (for example `sites`, `siteDotCom`)

The --files consists in a comma-separated list of [glob patterns](https://www.npmjs.com/package/globby)

> **Warning:** Negated patterns always have the highest precedence

#### using --diff

```bash
sfdy deploy -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -s --diff='behindBranch..aheadBranch'
```

The `--diff` flag is used to compute the list of files that needs to be deployed comparing 2 git branches. (examples: `--diff='origin/myBranch..HEAD'` or `--diff='branch1..branch2`). As an example of use case, you can trigger a deploy to the DEV environment when you create a pull-request to the dev branch. The deploy will contain only the files that have been modified in the pull-request

> **Warning:** the --diff option requires git. To use this feature you should be versioning your Salesforce project

#### using --diff and --files together

```bash
sfdy deploy -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -s --diff='behindBranch..aheadBranch' --files='!siteDotCom/**/*'
```

This is useful if you want to perform a delta deploy skipping some metadata that could be included by the `--diff` option. Typical use case: production and sandbox orgs have different versions and some metadata can't be deployed

### Perform a quick deploy

```bash
sfdy deploy -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -s --quick-deploy=0Af1k000028frDD
```

This command will perform a quick deploy of the deployment identified by the passed id

### Deploy a destructive changeset

Just run a [partial deploy](#deploy-partial-metadata) passing the `--destructive` flag

```bash
sfdy deploy -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -s --files='objects/*,!objects/Account*,site*/**/*' --destructive
```

You can also run a destructive deploy changeset with a custom destructiveChanges.xml path:

```bash
sfdy deploy -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -s --destructive <destructiveChanges.xml path>
```

Optionally you can pass the `--ignoreWarnings` flag to ignore deploy warnings

```bash
sfdy deploy -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -s --destructive <destructiveChanges.xml path> --ignoreWarnings
```

> **Warning:** Full destructive deploy is deliberately not supported

> **Warning:** This command deletes the metadata files from Salesforce, but they remain on the filesystem

### Publish a community

```bash
sfdy community:publish -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -s --community-name=myCoolCommunity
```

This command will programmatically publish your Experience Bundle. Execute it in a pipeline after a deployment to avoid the manual publish step!

### Apply 'standard' patches and renderers to metadata

Sfdy provides a number of ready-to-use patches that you may find useful.
All these patches serve 2 purposes:

1. **Remove useless metadata** (not translated fields, useless FLS in permission sets, roles that are automatically managed by salesforce, profile permissions in standard profiles, stuff created by managed packages at installation time)
2. **Add useful metadata**. We want our repo to really be the 'source of truth' (ALL profile permissions, not only the enabled ones. ALL object permissions. Profile configuration of objects/applications/tabs that we DON'T want to version because they're not used or we're not the mantainer of those metadata)

All of these patches can be disabled, so you can incrementally adopt them or skip a specific patch if you don't find it useful.

In addition to metadata patching, `sfdy` provides an out-of-the-box renderer to handle static resource bundles.

First of all, create the configuration file `.sfdy.json` in the root folder of the salesforce project:

```bash
sfdy init
```

The configuration file is a JSON object:

```json
{
  "permissionSets": {
    "stripUselessFls": true
  },
  "objectTranslations": {
    "stripUntranslatedFields": true,
    "stripNotVersionedFields": true
  },
  "preDeployPlugins": [],
  "postRetrievePlugins": [],
  "renderers": [],
  "profiles": {
    "addAllUserPermissions": false,
    "addDisabledVersionedObjects": true,
    "addExtraObjects": ["*", "!*__?", "!CommSubscription*"],
    "addExtraTabVisibility": ["standard-*"],
    "addExtraApplications": ["standard__*"],
    "stripUserPermissionsFromStandardProfiles": true,
    "stripUnversionedStuff": true
  },
  "roles": {
    "stripPartnerRoles": true
  },
  "staticResources": {
    "useBundleRenderer": ["*.resource"]
  },
  "stripManagedPackageFields": ["et4ae5"]
}
```

#### permissionSets

| Patch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| stripUselessFls | if `stripUselessFls` is `true`, `fieldPermissions` in which both `readable` and `editable` tags are `false` are removed from the XML. They are totally redundand since a `PermissionSet` can only add permissions. |

#### objectTranslations

| Patch | Metadata | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| stripUntranslatedFields | Translations, CustomObjectTranslation, GlobalValueSetTranslation, StandardValueSetTranslation  | if `stripUntranslatedFields` is `true`, untranslated tags are removed from the XML. |
| stripNotVersionedFields | CustomObjectTranslation | if `stripNotVersionedFields` is `true`, translated fields that are not present in the file system in the corresponding `.object` files, are removed from the XML. |

#### profiles

| Patch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| addAllUserPermissions | Salesforce does not retrieve disabled `userPermissions`. If `addAllUserPermissions` is `true`, all permissions are retrieved |
| addDisabledVersionedObjects | Salesforce does not retrieve totally disabled objects. If `addDisabledVersionedObjects` is `true`, sfdy retrieves also `objectsPermissions` of objects that are present in the file system (and of course tracked by version control systems)) but are disabled for the profile |
| addExtraObjects | Sometimes you want to explicitly configure the access level to some objects even if you're not interested in versioning the whole object metadata. Now you can. `addExtraObjects` is an array of glob patterns of the objects of which `objectPermissions` you want to add to the profile (the glob patterns match against the `<member>` content in `package.xml`) |
| addExtraTabVisibility | Sometimes you want to explicitly set the `TabVisibility` of some tabs even if you're not interested in versioning the object/tab metadata. Now you can. `addExtraTabVisibility` is an array of glob patterns of the tabs whose `tabVisibilities` you want to add to the profile (the glob patterns match against the `<member>` content in `package.xml`) |
| stripUserPermissionsFromStandardProfiles | User Permissions are not editable in standard profiles, and they change almost every Salesforce release causing errors that can be avoided. Set this flag to `true` to automatically remove them |
| stripUnversionedStuff | This flag 'sanitizes' the profiles, removing `fieldPermissions`, `classAccesses`, `pageAccesses`, `layoutAssignments` that are not related to stuff tracked under version control. I can't really see any reason not to enable this option, that can help avoiding errors made by developers during code/metadata versioning |

#### roles

| Patch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| stripPartnerRoles | if `stripPartnerRoles` is `true`, roles that end with `PartnerUser[0-9]*.role` are removed even if a `*` is used in `package.xml`. They are automatically created by Salesforce when you create a Partner Account, so there's no need to track them them using version control |

#### staticResources

| Renderer | Metadata | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| useBundleRenderer | StaticResource | glob pattern to identify static resource files to handle as an uncompressed bundle. The `contentType` of the `.resource-meta.xml` file must be `application/zip`. This renderer retrieves directly the uncompressed folder instead of the `.resource` file. If you deploy a single file inside the bundle, the `.resource` file is rebuilded behind the scenes and deployed in place of the single specified file

#### other

| Patch | Metadata | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| stripManagedPackageFields | CustomObject, PermissionSet, Profile | Array of namespaces of stuff created by managed packages (eg Marketing Cloud) that we don't want to track changes using Version Control. This plugin removes `fields`, `picklistValues`, `weblinks` from `CustomObject` and `fieldPermissions` from `Profile` and `PermisissionSet` |

### Build your own plugins

`sfdy` offers a convenient way to develop your own plugins. This is really useful in many cases. A simple  use case may be changing named credential's endpoints or email addresses in workflow's email alerts based on the target org, but the possibilities are endless. You can even query salesforce (rest api or tooling api) to conditionally apply transformations to the metadata on the basis of information coming from the target org.

All the standard plugins are built using the plugin engine of `sfdy`, so the best reference to understand how to develop a custom plugin is to look at the [plugins](src/plugins) folder in which all the standard plugins reside.

A plugin is a `.js` module that exports a function with this signature:

```javascript
module.exports = async (context, helpers, utils) => {
  //TODO -> Plugin implementation
}
```

#### `context`

- `sfdcConnector` - an instance of a Salesforce connector. It exposes 2 methods, `query` and `rest`
- `environment` - The value of the environment variable `environment`. It can be used to execute different patches in different sandboxes
- `username` - The username used to login
- `log` - A `log` function that should be used instead of `console.log` if you want to log something. The reason is that, when used as a library, `sfdy` can accept a custom logger implementation. When used as a command line tool, the `log` function fallbacks to `console.log`
- `pkg` - A json representation of the `package.xml`
- `config` - The content of `.sfdy.json` (as a JSON object)

#### `helpers`

- `xmlTransformer (pattern, callback1)` - This helper allows the developer to easily transform one or more metadata (identified by `pattern`), using a `callback` function. See [examples](#examples) to understand how to use it
- `modifyRawContent (pattern, callback2)` - This helper allows the developer to manipulate the whole metadata file. It is useful if you want to edit a file that is not an xml, or if you want to apply drastic transformations
- `filterMetadata (filterFn)` - This helper can be used in a post-retrieve plugin to filter out unwanted metadata
- `requireMetadata (pattern, callback3)` - This helper can be used to define dependencies between metadata. For example, a `Profile` must be retrieved together with `CustomObject` metadata in order to retrieve the list of `fieldPermissions`. By defining such a dependency using `requireMetadata`, whenever you retrieve a `Profile`, all dependent metadata are automatically included in the `package.xml` and eventually discarded at the end of the retrieve operation, just to retrieve all the relted parts of the original metadata you wanted to retrieve
- `addRemapper (regex, callback4)` - This helper can be used to map an arbitrary file to a file representing a Salesforce metadata. For example, it can be used to instruct `sfdy` to deploy/retrieve a `.resource` file when you deploy/retrieve a file inside an uncompressed bundle. `regex` is a `RegExp` object defining the matching patterns

##### `callback1 (filename, fJson, requireFiles, addFiles, cleanFiles)`

- `filename` - The current filename
- `fJson`  -  JSON representation of the XML. You can modify the object to modify the XML
- `requireFiles (filenames: string[]): Promise<Entry[]>` - An async function taking an array of glob patterns and returning an array of `{ fileName: string, data: Buffer }` objects representing files. The files are taken from memory if you are requiring files that you are retrieving/deploying, otherwise they are searched in the filesystem. These files will be added to the files that will be retrieved/deployed unless you specify a filter with the `filterMetadata` helper. This helper is useful when you want to act on a metadata on the basis on another one (for example you need to retrieve the versioned fields from a `.object` file to add/delete FLS from `profiles`).
- `addFiles (entries: Entry[])` - A function taking an array of `{ fileName: string, data: Buffer }` objects representing files. This function is similar to `requireFiles`. The main difference is that `requireFiles` looks for existing files, while `addFiles` let you add arbitrary data to the retrieved/deployed files. For this reason, it is best suited to be used in a `renderer`
- `cleanFiles (filenames: string[])` - A function taking an array of glob patterns. This function let you specify files that should be deleted. It should be used in the context of an after retrieve plugin or a transform renderer (for example it is used to clean up an uncompressed staticresource bundle before uncompressing the `.resource` file coming from Salesforce)

##### `callback2 (filename, file, requireFiles, addFiles, cleanFiles)`

- `filename` - The current filename
- `file` is an object containing a `data` field. `data` is a buffer containing the whole file. You can modify `data` to modify the file
- `requireFiles (filenames: string[]): Promise<Entry[]>` - See [callback1](#callback1-filename-fjson-requirefiles-addfiles-cleanfiles)
- `addFiles (entries: Entry[])` - See [callback1](#callback1-filename-fjson-requirefiles-addfiles-cleanfiles)
- `cleanFiles (filenames: string[])` - See [callback1](#callback1-filename-fjson-requirefiles-addfiles-cleanfiles)

##### `filterFn (filename)`

- `filename: string` - The current filename, including the path (for example `classes/MyClass.cls`)

##### `callback3 ({ filterPackage, requirePackage })`

- `filterPackage (arrayOfMetadata: string[])` - A function taking an array of metadata that should be included together with metadata matched by `pattern`. The 'companions' will be retrieved only if they are present in the stored `package.xml`. For example, if you retrieve a profile, the profile will be retrieved together with the referenced `CustomObject`

- `requirePackage (arrayOfMetadata: string[])` - The same as `filterPackage`, but the included metadata will be added to `package.xml` whether they were present before or not. In this case `arrayOfMetadata` is an array of 'pseudo' glob patterns (ex. `['CustomApplication/*', 'CustomObject/Account']`)

##### `callback4 (fileName, regexp): string`

- `fileName: string` - The current filename, including the path (for example `classes/MyClass.cls`)
- `regexp: RegExp` - The regexp originally passed to the helper
- return value: a string representing the mapped filename

### utils `{ parseXml, buildXml, parseXmlNoArray }`

Helpers function. See [here](src/utils/xml-utils.js)

To instruct `sfdy` to use your plugin, you have to configure the path of your plugin in the `.sfdy.json` file:

```json
{
  "preDeployPlugins": ["sfdy-plugins/my-awesome-plugin.js"],
  "postRetrievePlugins": ["sfdy-plugins/my-wonderful-plugin.js"]
}
```

You have 2 different 'hooks' to choose from:

- `postRetrievePlugins` are executed just before the metadata retrieved from Salesforce is stored on the filesystem
- `preDeployPlugins` are executed before deploying metadata to Salesforce

#### Examples

##### Change the endpoint of a named credential (better suited as a `preDeployPlugin`)

```javascript
module.exports = async ({ environment, log }, helpers) => {
  helpers.xmlTransformer('namedCredentials/*', async (filename, fJson) => {
    log(`Patching ${filename}...`)    
    if(filename === 'idontwanttochangethis.NamedCredential') return

    switch(environment) {
      case 'uat':
        fJson.endpoint = 'https://uat-endpoint.com/restservice'
        break
      case 'prod':
        fJson.endpoint = 'https://prod-endpoint.com/restservice'
        break
      default:
        fJson.endpoint = 'https://test-endpoint.com/restservice'
        break
      
      log('Done')    
    }
  })
}
```

##### Remove every field and every apex class that starts with `Test_` (better suited as a `postRetrievePlugin`)

```javascript
module.exports = async ({ environment, log }, helpers) => {
  helpers.xmlTransformer('objects/*', async (filename, fJson) => {
    log(`Patching ${filename}...`)    
    fJson.fields = (fJson.fields || []).filter(field => !field.FullName[0].startsWith('Test_'))
    log('Done')        
  })

  helpers.filterMetadata(fileName => !/classes\/Test_[^\/]+\.cls$/.test(fileName))
}
```

> **Warning:** fJson contains the json representation of the metadata file. The root tag of the metadata is omitted for convenience. Every tag is treated as an array

> **Warning:** The callback function ot the `xmlTransformer` helper MUST return a `Promise`

##### Query Salesforce to apply advanced transformations

See [this](src/plugins/profile-plugins/add-all-permissions-to-custom-profiles.js)

##### Define dependencies between metadata

See [this](src/plugins/dependency-graph.js)

### Build your own renderers

A renderer is a `.js` file that exports an object with this signature:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  transform: async (context, helpers, utils) => {
    //TODO -> Transform
  },
  untransform: async (context, helpers, utils) => {
    //TODO -> Untransform
  }
}
```

The `transform` function is applied after the retrieve operation and after the execution of the post-retrieve plugins. The `untransform` function is applied as soon as you start a deploy, before the application of the pre deploy plugins and the actual deploy.

A renderer can be used to totally transform the metadata in the format you like. For example, you could think to split a `.object` file in different files, one for `fields` and one per `recordtypes`, or to even convert everything in json, or to represent some information as a `.csv` file. You can do what best fit your needs.

To instruct `sfdy` to use your renderer, you have to configure the path of your renderer in the `.sfdy.json` file:

```json
{
  "renderers": ["sfdy-plugins/my-awesome-renderer.js"]
}
```

> **Tip:** You do not have to include the renderer whithin your salesforce project to be able to use it, so you can use your plugin referencing it from all of your project workspaces!

#### Example - Store profiles as json files

```js
module.exports = {
  transform: async (context, helpers, { parseXmlNoArray }) => {
    helpers.modifyRawContent('profiles/*', async (filename, file) => {
      const fJson = await parseXmlNoArray(file.data)
      file.data = Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(fJson, null, 2), 'utf8')
    })
  },
  untransform: async (context, helpers, { buildXml }) => {
    helpers.modifyRawContent('profiles/*', async (filename, file) => {
      const fJson = JSON.parse(file.data.toString())
      file.data = Buffer.from(buildXml(fJson), 'utf8')
    })
  }
}
```

#### Example - Handle zip staticresources as uncompressed folders

See [here](src/renderers/static-resource-bundle.js)

### Use `sfdy` as a library

It's as simple as that:

```bash
npm i sfdy
```

#### retrieve

```js
const retrieve = require('sfdy/src/retrieve')

retrieve({
  basePath: 'root/folder',
  config: {
    //.sfdy.json like config
  },
  files: [ /*specific files*/ ],
  loginOpts: {
    serverUrl: creds.url,
    username: creds.username,
    password: creds.password
  },
  meta: [/*specific meta*/]
  logger: (msg: string) => logger.appendLine(msg)
}).then(() => console.log('Done!'))
```

#### deploy

```js
const deploy = require('sfdy/src/deploy')

deploy({
  logger: (msg: string) => logger.appendLine(msg),
  preDeployPlugins,
  renderers,
  basePath: 'root/folder',
  loginOpts: {
    serverUrl: creds.url,
    username: creds.username,
    password: creds.password
  },
  checkOnly,
  files: ['specific', 'files']
}).then(() => console.log('Done!'))
```
